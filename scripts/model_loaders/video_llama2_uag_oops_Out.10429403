You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

Answer: Based on what I have just seen and heard, it appears that a father is playing with his young son in their bedroom. The father is jumping and spinning around the room, while the son is laughing and trying to keep up with him. The video is shot in a close-up and slow-motion style, which emphasizes the father's energetic movements and the son's joyful reactions.
